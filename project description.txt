In this project, I delved into a rich dataset to cover insights and sales in pizza Shop.

The Asssignment:

The pizza sales in the pizza shop to find the total revenue, Expensive pizza, Popular size, Top Category, Busiest hour.

Recommendations:

As the busiest hour is 12, then the focus on the supply of pizza to customers without any shortage of mostly selling pizza.

Offering discounts or buy one get one free on slow moving items can boost sales and can increase the sales volume.

Key insights:

overall 21350 pizzas are ordered which makes the 817860.05rs of revenue.

Everyday is able to sell 138 pizzas daily.
